# 🇸🇦 Account Recovery

**Author:** ViRuS-HaCkEr
**Version:** 1.0  
**License:** MIT

A simple CLI helper that builds professional account recovery messages, copies them to the clipboard, saves them locally, and opens the official support/contact page for the selected platform.

---
Supported platforms :
---

- Snapchat
- Instagram
- X (Twitter)
- WhatsApp

---

## 📌 Quick summary :

This tool helps you prepare a complete recovery message when an account is hacked, suspended, disabled, or inaccessible. It:
- Builds a ready-to-send message (English)
- Copies the message to the system clipboard (fallback: saves to file)
- Saves the message as `recovery_<platform>_<id>.txt`
- Opens the official support page for the chosen platform
- Prints colored terminal output for easier usage

**Note:** This tool does NOT contact support automatically. It only helps you compose and submit a message using the official support channels. Use only for accounts you own or manage.

## 📥 Quick start :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virus0hacker/account_recovery.git
```
---
Run :
---

```bash
python account_recovery.py
```

Follow the prompts: choose a platform, enter account identifier (username/email/phone), describe the issue briefly, and enter a preferred contact. The message will be copied to the clipboard (or saved to recovery_message.txt) and the official support page will open in your browser
